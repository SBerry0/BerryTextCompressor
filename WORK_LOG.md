It is really not looking great so far, everything is really messy, I think I'm going to try to get the words a little differently. |
| 12/3/24 |  8:35-9:20pm  | I tried fiddling around with the SpellingBee code I imported into this to get each word, but it didn't really result in anything. Then I realized I didn't have to do it recursively, so I found out the length of the longest common word and I'm planning on checking into the next 1-10 letters to compare to a common word. It's going to be really slow, but I think it will work better. |
