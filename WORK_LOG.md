| 12/3/24  | 11:15-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I sort of mapped out what I'm planning to do, then I started to try to do it. It is really not looking great so far, everything is really messy, I think I'm going to try to get the words a little differently. |
| 12/3/24  |  8:35-9:20pm  |                                                               I tried fiddling around with the SpellingBee code I imported into this to get each word, but it didn't really result in anything. Then I realized I didn't have to do it recursively, so I found out the length of the longest common word and I'm planning on checking into the next 1-10 letters to compare to a common word. It's going to be really slow, but I think it will work better. |
| 12/6/24  |  2:20-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I started with the new attempt at the solutions. I'm still trying to fully understand the way I should write the code, but I think I have a good conceptual understanding of it. |
| 12/10/24 |  8:00-8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                        I think I'm getting a little closer to what I'm trying to get, I fixed the loop to make it check whether or not the next letter is in the codes. But, I'm a little confused about when to use getlongestprefix vs lookup for the TSTs. I also don't really know how to change the prefix in the code. |
| 12/11/24 | 10:15-10:45am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I fixed a little bit about the tst and how I was preloading it with all the initial characters. I think I'm doing something wrong with the loop and the way it is stopping though. |
| 12/11/24 |  6:15-6:55pm  | So, I finally made some proper progress. I started with setting up the ability to print out all the prefixes and the corresponding codes that would be put into the TST. It looked a little confusing so I did out what ABRACADABRABRABRA should be on paper and compared it with what I had. I was pretty close initially, I was just writing out the wrong thing which was a major silly and I think I was just overthinking it too hard. Now onto expand. |
| 12/11/24 |  7:10-7:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I made the expand now and it seems to work pretty well on abra. The compression ratio is above 100%, but I'm pretty sure that's because I'm using 12 bits for each code. I'm going to test it on the other files now, hope they work. |
| 12/11/24 | 10:00-10:50pm |                                                                                                                                                                  I made a few adjustments after testing on Alice and now that works very nicely. Unfortunately though, when I test on shakespeare, the decompression stops after a few lines because it is reading a code it hasn't made yet. I can't figure out why this could be happening. Very annoying. |
